                "text": "Selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM), or light sheet microscopy, is a powerful imaging approach. However, access to and interfacing microscopes with microfluidics have remained challenging. Complex interfacing with microfluidics has limited the SPIM&amp;rsquo;s utility for studying the hydrodynamics of freely moving multicellular organisms. We developed SPIM-Flow, an inexpensive light sheet platform that enables easy integration with microfluidics. We used SPIM-Flow to investigate the hydrodynamics of a freely moving Hydra polyp via particle tracking in millimeter-sized chambers. Initial experiments across multiple animals, feeding on a chip (Artemia franciscana nauplii used as food), and baseline behaviors (tentacle swaying, elongation, and bending) indicated the organisms&amp;rsquo; health inside the system. Fluidics were used to investigate Hydra&amp;rsquo;s response to flow. The results suggested that the animals responded to an established flow by bending and swaying their tentacles in the flow direction. Finally, using SPIM-Flow in a proof-of-concept experiment, the shear stress required to detach an animal from a surface was demonstrated. Our results demonstrated SPIM-Flow&amp;rsquo;s utility for investigating the hydrodynamics of freely moving animals.",
