Number of attendees was quite small (8-20) but this feature makes the meeting more interactive and informal. Questions and discussions were key elements of the meetings.\n\nDo you have any feedback (good and bad things) about your experience in joining the LightSheet bites?\n\nWe’d like to discuss more L-sheet topics (and organise more bites..)! If you have any topics that you’d like us to tackle or if you think that you have some skills\/knowledge you’d like to share, we are very happy to hear from you! Note: The organising committee will support in any way you need from finding the speaker to organising the Zoom meeting..)\n\nThanks for having joined the meetings and enjoy the L-sheets!\n\nThe WildSheet Lsg-org",
