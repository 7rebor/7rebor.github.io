I have a question about clearing protocol, so maybe you can help in this group :slightly_smiling_face: We are going to try iDISCO but we are struggling a bit to find glass vials to keep the samples. We want the vials to be not more than 5-10 mL total volume (so we save DBE) but the bottle neck should be around 1.5-2 mm if we want to be able to introduce our specimens... any of you can recommend glass vials that you have in your places? All 5 mL vials we find have a bottle neck diameter of 1 or 1.3 mm :disappointed: THANKS A LOT!!",

Alternatively, I have also seen a certain type of EP tubes that are compatible with DBE and DCM. That will for sure limit the incubation volume :wink:\n\nAdipo-Clear is a protocol adapted from iDISCO\/iDISCO+ that uses also DCM and DBE.
