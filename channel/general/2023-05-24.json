NOTE: this doesn't always happen\n• Open-top reservoir is a little prone to spillage\n• Glass coverslip sits on top of reservoir and if you get medium on it, it needs cleaning, which takes time and can be frustrating\n• Need to re-calibrate the SLM every time you want to acquire images at a different zoom or refractive index. I.e. there is no way to save these files for each combo and just load up a previous file from a previous SLM calibration - they will work on this, I'm sure\n• No user config files saved for the software, so can't save settings for an acquisition to return to the next day\nThere are probably more, happy to show it\/talk about it to anyone who wants to see it, by Zoom or in person.",
