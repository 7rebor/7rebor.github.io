For hard samples like from DISCO methods I just use cap from the big black Eppendorf, its cheap and easy to remove the sample. For whole mouse which i much bigger, I saw in the paper its even possible to mount on UMII but Lifecanvas has a different holder. We probably will end up 3dprinting the bigger holder that can hold the mouse."
