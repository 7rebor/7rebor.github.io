So, it seems that is something related to the sample (or the agar) that can make a kind of “reflection” of the image; that`s what we conclude discussing also with the Lavision support; and I can`t find better explanation and is an issue that is hard to replicate (fortunately); I`ve anyone has better ideas, I`ll close the issue and try to cope with that.",
