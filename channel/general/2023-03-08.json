The microscope has a fully automated objective turret that hosts up to three MI Plan objective lenses which are optimized for high-resolution light sheet imaging. It also comes with an automated magnification changer (0.6×, 1×, 1.67×, and 2.5×) allowing magnifications from 0.66× to 30×. Fully equipped UltraMicroscope Blaze Beam Combiner 4.2 is a completely configured light sheet microscope with three MI Plan objective lenses (1.1×, 4×, and 12×), five laser lines (405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm, 639 nm, and 785 nm) and a 4.2 Mpx sCMOS camera.Likewise, fully equipped UltraMicroscope Blaze Beam Combiner 5.5 is a completely configured light sheet microscope with three MI Plan objective lenses (1.1×, 4×, and 12×), dipping caps covering all clearing solutions, 5 laser lines (405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm, 639 nm, and 785 nm) and a 5.5 Mpx sCMOS camera. | Great Britain",
