I have personally not yet seen a great scan from samples that had AF790 as secondary antibody or have it conjugated with the primary antibody. Penetration seems often quite bad, signals would be weak and superficial even if the primary is known to work well with other AF. I have also not found any convincing great results from publications (AF790 seem to be rarely used, and the images in the publications also show rather superficial signals), nor could I find the molecular structure of AF790 while the other AFs were available so that I couldn't start speculating based on that either...\n\nIt could just be that I had suboptimal experimental setups (e.g. Ab conc. being too high) and that I've been unlucky with the literature searches. I wonder if anyone here had good experience with AF790. I understand that the quantum efficiency of the cameras &amp; the continuum laser output power are both not in favor of AF790's wavelength range, but the poor penetration...?\n\nThanks!\nPuzzled clearing &amp; SPIM nerdling, Sunny",
