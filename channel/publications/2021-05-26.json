So rather than a reviewing the existing literature and trying to summarize which technique is best for which sample, it teaches you how to approach the topic and what to watch out for. We address common pitfalls and provide guidelines for designing, optimizing and imaging in a successful tissue-clearing experiment with a focus on light-sheet microscopy. I hope you enjoy it! <https:\/\/rdcu.be\/ck4g1>",
