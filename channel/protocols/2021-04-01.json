        "text": "Hi Dee, in my case I never had big issues in clearing agar cubes..I do at least 4 steps in methanol (increasing concentration ), at least 2 hours each,gently shaking, RT,  as suggested by Anjalie; in my experience is quite useful to look at the agar surface once in solution: if you can see the light reflecting on it..it still needs to be left in the solution more time. The main issue, can be the agars shrikage and breaking..For that I think is even more important to do long incubation time; just let me know if yo need more info!",
