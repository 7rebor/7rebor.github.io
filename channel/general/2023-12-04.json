This image shows a single slice through a collagen hydrogel (made of human collagen I; VitroCol from Advanced Biomatrix) with human T cells (A3R5.7 cells stably expressing LifeAct-EGFP) embedded in it. This is using an iSPIM light sheet microscope, with single-sided (hence the shadow streaks!) illumination with a 640 nm laser.\n\nExposure settings had to be quite harsh because the signal was very very dim. However, you can see that the collagen fibers do indeed light up, which was nice to see! Unfortunately, what we also see a lot of is that some of the cells seem to pick up the dye as well, and this dye that is taken up by cells actually appears quite bright. I picked a relatively cell-sparse slice to show the fibers. You are seeing the top couple of hundred microns of the hydrogel, with the top being on the right. The blurriness you see on the right is not real, my light sheet was not very well aligned at the time...\n\nThe FastGreen FCF staining was done as follows:\n• Dissolved the powder in sterile PBS at 100 mg\/mL\n• Added the dye at 100 ug\/mL directly into the gel\/cell mixture while the gel was forming\n• Allowed the gel to form as normal, immersed hydrogel in (phenol red-free) medium, and imaged the next day\nWe also tried the dye at 1 mg\/mL but saw no improvement in signal intensity. At this point I just don't think it works very well in unfixed samples and I am probably not going to continue using it, unless I have a student looking for a quick project and want them to try out a few more conditions... but not sure what else I would try. Maybe going even lower in concentration, in case the dye is self-quenching? Maybe dissolving it in DMSO? Ideas welcome!",
