I was hoping to find out if people have a fixed perfusion system in use and if so could give any recommendations?\nAnd secondly I saw the above discussion about dyes for the dye alignment. In addition to that, what do you tend do for different laser lines - do you align them to the 488 laser and fine tune them with tetraspeck bead samples or do you use additional dyes for them? \nThanks in advance for any pointers :)",
