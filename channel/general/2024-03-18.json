The school will feature presentations by globally renowned experts, interactive imaging workshops, and a variety of additional activities with plenty of time for discussions and insights. We will have 3x of our light sheet systems there; the MuVi (flexible, live and cleared), LCS (Large Cleared Samples) and TruLive (long-term, live imaging), all supported by our HIVE data management system. You can also bring your own samples. Details on how to register are on the attached PDF and we are excited to work with the community on this event!",
