This brings unique challenges and struggles for LS users, but rest assured you are not alone!\n\n*This is a community for all those out there, in the wild, with any and every light sheet technology. Our main focus at Wildsheet is to provide a friendly, accessible space for people to discuss their experiences with LS technologies.*\n\nThe purpose of the Wildsheet Slack workspace is to provide a platform for:\n-      Meeting and networking with LS users, builders, vendors and other LS fanatics\n-      Creating and maintaining smaller shared interest groups\n-      Asking for help and advice in a friendly, accessible and informal environment\n-      Facilitating organisation and promotion of virtual and in-person meetings\n-      Sharing resources and best practices\n-      Discussing the needs of the LS community\n\nWe hope that you find this workspace useful and we encourage you to engage and tailor it in any way that you need.
