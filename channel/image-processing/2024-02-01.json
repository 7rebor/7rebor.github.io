Many of my files are in the 10s-100s of GB, and I am struggling with how to manage them so they can be run through our segmentation pipeline. Either advice on breaking up the files to be passed through fiji\/cellpose and then reconstructed or another method of segmentation that works on large files would be really appreciated! Thanks",
