        "text": "Hi Werther, I have quite an experience of many strange artefacts using the Lavision..but I can`t recognize this one; I see something similar when using viscous imaging media (such as CUBIC) and \"waves\" of solutions with slightly different RI mix together; was the medium an organic solvent or a semi-saturated solution? Other option: I was imaging some kind if 3D printed scaffolds with a regular pattern, and I could spot some crazy signal (a kind of interference\/diffraction pattern): may the pattern of the vessels can create a kind of interference? Maybe in combination with light-absorbing molecules on the sample surface?.. What is the artefact: the bright thin lines or maybe the dark thick shadows? Also, using the dynamic focus I found many crazy patterns; may this be the cause? Where you using the dynamic focus? Hope it helps: if you want you can send me the raw data and I can take a deeper look; cheers",

If you have illuminated the sample from left or right, then these stripes are most likely the usual shadowing artifacts you get in light sheet microscopy when the sheet is partially absorbed by pigments etc in the sample. They can be suppressed by one of three ways: 1. better clearing, 2. pivoting the light sheet during the exposure (mSPIM) 3. computationally post acquisition (at the cost of losing resolution along the vertical direction).",
