Especially the excitation PSF from the different systems is not calculated optimally.\nI use Hyugens and the Lighsheet Deconvolution in ZEN Blue. Both are not optimal.\nIn my opinion, the left and right light sheet should  be deconvolved separately (with the scatter paramaters ) and then blending is done based on the decon data. The decon in ZEN Blue can only handle already processed light sheets (Max or DFT)) which is not the best way and Huygens can handle left and right separately but then it lacks a reasonable solution for blending both data sets. The BigSticher has a very good solution to use the left and right light sheets (depending on the position in the dataset) but it lacks a reasonable deconvolution.\nYou see a huge topic.....",
