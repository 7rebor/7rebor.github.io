Alongside Pavel Tomancak we have been driving the community forward, organizing courses and conferences and currently a book ( probably outdated already) is underway. We have also been involved with the development of the Zeiss Z1 and 7. Our group has done a lot of works on sample preparation and the use of 3D printing and 3D bioprinting to make holders and so on. So we have a lot ot tips and experience in teaching so happy to help remotely anyone. More recently we have started a couple of hardware projects to use light sheet \"in the wild\" for underwater study of ctneophores and jellyfishes but also portable light sheet systems to expand the light sheet microscopy in developing countries and teach courses.",
