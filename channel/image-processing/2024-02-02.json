Unfortunately the bulk of the data comes from the multiview and the high resolution in z, the latter of which is necessary for the research question I am asking. Dropping to single view helps significantly, but downsampling loses the detail I need (I agree this would be the easiest solution!). The files themselves don’t actually have many tiles, but they have huge z stacks because I am trying to quantify the cross-section of a sample that is difficult to mount. Thanks for the link for the cellpose chunking, I’ll have a look at that and try splitting the tiles as suggested :slightly_smiling_face: .",
