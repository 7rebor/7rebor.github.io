The symposium is aimed at all prospective and existing scientists using light-sheet microscopy, from those thinking of using it for the first time, to the established researchers using and developing methodology and technology.\n\nMore preliminary information about poster, registration and program are available at the Symposium website: <https:\/\/www.crick.ac.uk\/whats-on\/light-sheet-in-action-structural-and-dynamic-microscopy-from-cells-to-animals>\n\nPlease save the date for this Symposium (or rather, SPIMposium!), an .ics file to add to your calendar can be found attached or at the link below.\n<https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1jpsmHgm5gA2Qqn3-AcOkWitAdPZLSkHb\/>\n\n*Monday 22nd April 2024* \n*10:00 - 18:30* \n*at <https:\/\/www.crick.ac.uk\/|The Francis Crick Institute>, London, UK.*\n\nAmple opportunities will be given for attendees to present talks and posters, discuss during breaks or focussed sessions, meet specialists from microscopy facilities and companies, and most importantly, have an enjoyable time with the community.\n\nThe program is still preliminary, but we are glad to announce the keynote speaker will be:\n\n*Jan Huisken*\nHumboldt Professor of Multiscale Biology\nGeorg-August-University Göttingen\n<https:\/\/huiskenlab.com\/>\n\nAdditionally, a *workshop* will be organised after the symposium where it will be possible to get hands-on with light-sheet microscopes either at The Francis Crick Institute or in facilities nearer to your location.\n\nWe hope you will join us!\n\n*Light-sheet in Action Committee*\n\nAlessandro Ciccarelli, Rob Lees, Helena Coker, George Chennell, Christopher Thrasivoulou\n\n*We are grateful for the support from Miltenyi Biotec, Bruker-Luxendo, Viventis and the Crick Partnership Networking Fund*",
