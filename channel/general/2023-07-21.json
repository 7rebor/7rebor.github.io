It was great to know the applications and problems users were having to share fixes and show demand for fixes from Zeiss (thanks Helena). Maybe 3i want to do a CTLS one <@U01KN82Q4MN>, or Bruker a LCS\/MuVi one <@U058WJ0Q4RG>?\n• The XYZ projection plugin for ImageJ <@U01GHGN71UL>?\nNEXT MEETING END OF AUGUST where <@U04RH8K303Y> may present outcomes of Fast 3D and LifeCanvas clearing (mixture of steps, artifacts in samples and hopefully a better protocol overall!)\n\nCheers! :raised_hands::skin-tone-3:",
