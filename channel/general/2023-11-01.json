They said that they had not specifically tried staining hydrogels, but that staining in aqueous conditions (PBS or water, didn't matter) required much higher amounts of the dye as it was less efficient. They recommended staining with 100 ug\/mL (again, in either PBS or water) and follow that up with a few washes before imaging.\n\nWe will be trying this out very soon and will post results here!",
